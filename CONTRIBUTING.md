# How to contribute to the JKL programming language

### Did you find a bug?
- ### Do not open up a Github issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in JKL, and instead refer to our security policy (soon).
- ### Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
- ### If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
- ### Opean a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- ### Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
- ### Suggest your change on the discord server and start writing code.
- ### Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
### Do you have questions about the source code?
- ### Ask any question about how to use JKL on the discord server

JKL is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team.
