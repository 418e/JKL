## Introduction

Tron is a modern programming language that prioritizes developer comfort and flexibility. With Tron, you can choose from a variety of syntax options to express your ideas in the way that feels most natural to you. Whether you prefer concise function declarations or more descriptive ones, Tron adapts to your style.

## Features

- **Multiple Syntax Choices**: Use different keywords to represent the same concept, allowing you to write code that aligns with your preferences.
- **Fast Execution**: Compiled with Rust's performance in mind, Tron programs run swiftly and efficiently.
- **Open Source**: Tron is developed openly on GitHub, and we welcome contributions from the community.

## Quick Start

To get started with Tron, install the Tron interpreter on your system and create your first Tron program:

```bash
curl -sSL https://tronlang.org/install.sh | bash
```

Create a file named `main.tron` with the following content:

```tron
print "Hello, world!";
```

Run your program with:

```bash
tron main.tron
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, world!
```
