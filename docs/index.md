# Tron Programming Language

An Open Source, Fast and Simple Programming Language written in Rust.

## Why?

Why was Tron created? because I wasn't very comfortable with current programming languages and wanted to have my own programming language were I would feel comfortable hacking in. Syntax is very much rust like but simplified, I wanted the code to be more readible than it is in rust. Tron uses dynamic typing because when Tron was being designed, I didn't have enough experience, skills or resources to implement complex functionality such as typing, but in the future typing might be introduced.

## Why rust?

Interpreter of the Tron is 100% written in rust because of its' safety and speed. In addition Rust community may not be the biggest but it is rapidly increasing.
